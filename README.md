# hello-world
##My first projects on github
>Computers have always been an importent part of my life, how they work and how they can be used to create. My interest in programming started early, but I never had the confidence to dig deeper into it and learn more. Life takes different turns, but I have finally decided to persue my interests in programming on a more professional level. The road will be loooong, but that only means more fun and experience along the way.
>This repo will be used to learn github and do tutorials.
